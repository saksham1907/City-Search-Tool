# City-Search-Tool
There are a lot of factors that go into making a big move, and for many people, the top priority is either their job or their family. But if you’re on your own and you have job flexibility to go basically wherever you want (i.e. you work remotely), then what? In that case, you have the luxury of finding a place that suits you—and not necessarily just your career.

A myriad of decisions go into picking the perfect place to call home — political leanings, crime rates, walkability, affordability, religious affiliations, weather and more —
Here is a tool that allows aggie graduates and others to find thier next move.

Also I have applied PCA and K means clustering algorithm to group cities having similar characterstics
